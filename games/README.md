# group-worud97

**Group 8: Ben Celsi, Catherine Yoo, Ju An Oh, and Muatasim Qazi**

Our team will be building several mini-games.
Each team member will be making a different game. We all will create single home page that provides links to these individual games. Users can choose which game to play. 

Here are the games we will each be building:

## A web version of Parchís – Muatasim Qazi
I will be building a web-based version of a game similar to Parchís called **Ludo**. The game is mostly played in the Indian sub-continent. The web version can be played by a single player or multiple players on different computers simultaneously.

### Frameworks and Libraries
* React
* Material-UI
* Animate.css


## A keyboard version of DDR – Catherine Yoo
## A mini ping pong game – Ju An Oh
## A visually customizable version of "The Game of Life" – Ben Celsi
